### Requirement Gathering

Client wants a dashboard to capture a big picture of the COVID-19 vaccination data in the UK

#### a. Primary KPIs
- Number of people who had not received a vaccination

- Number of people who had received one vaccination only

- Number of people who had received two vaccinations only

- Number of people who had received at least 4 vaccinations



#### b. Secondary KPIs
- Proportion of people who had received at least 4 vaccinations by age group, ethnicity and religion

### Data Processing ⚙️

- The data is in a (relatively) tall format: The Group column collapses fields that should be individual columns into one one column.

- Using the Power Query Pivot Column feature, I pivoted the column into a wider format, bring the total column count to 64.

- Before pivoting, I changed all NA and Errors to zero because the pivoting operation is confused by strings in numeric columns.

- After pivoting, I replaced zeros to nulls and reordered the columns appropriately

### Data Visualization 🎨

- Power BI magic!✨ The report pbix file is available in this repo to explore design decisions (The file can only be opened in PowerBI)

  <a name="insights"/>
### Deriving Insights

- The older a person is, the more likely they have received at least 4 vaccinations

- Black Africans have the lowest vaccination rates at about 60%

- Jewish people have the highest vaccination rates
